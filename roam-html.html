<h4>Travelling is good for the soul. People like having small adventures to nearby locations. However, sometimes options can seem limited. As a tool to overcome <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble" class="has-tool-tip" style="position:relative;"> filter-bubble</a>
  and fit adventures of any length into our schedules, Roam was developed.</h4>
<h4>In the future, we hope to develop Roam into a site where people can store their previous destinations if desired, write a little bit about how the adventure went, and share with friends. We could futhermore potentially display the stories you write about your adventures on our homepage, and develop a culture of local Roamers. <3 </h4> 
<h4>We also hope to implement real <a href = "https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/analytics/make-a-walk-time-map/" class="has-tool-tip" style="position:relative;"> walk-time maps</a> into our algorithm, to give a more accurate time estimate of your adventures.</h4>

    <h3 class="list">Ditch the Car</h3>
    <h4><p>As students living in a spread-out, car-culture city, it felt like we needed the convenience of a car to do anything fun. However, as we walked more in the surrounding area, we saw the journey itself as the destination, and then cars seemed less important. We were also using a more diversified transportation system for our adventurous outings. We developed a small but strong pedestrian community, while reducing reliance on carbon-emitting vehicles! As an added bonus, we exercised our bodies (and spirits!).</p>

<p>“For Crosby, driving is most often a means to an end whereas walking is an end in itself, even when it is also a means to a destination. A driver may have a choice among several possible routes, but usually chooses the one that takes the least time. A pedestrian is freer to focus on the walk itself, the passing scene – the landscape, the buildings, the people, the birds, other animals, the gardens, the sounds and sights. The senses are more fully engaged, and the act of locomotion is more of a living bridge
between the walker and his or her environment. There are choices of a different kind, connections of a different kind, spontaneity of a different kind. As for convenience, its main virtue seems closely tied to the ego. The car culture is tightly bound to conscious purpose. Walking is more conditional, more circumstantial.”</p>
